/* 
 * calc_corr
 *
 * Calculates the block-wise autocorrelation of a channel of audio.
 * xp[n] is multiplied by xp[n+eta] and summed up over blocks of winL
 * points, hopped by frmL points, for nfrm points.  eta ranges from 
 * zero th lagL - 1.  ac
 * ac[frame*lagL+eta] = \sum_{n=0}^{winL-1} xp[frame*frmL+n]xp[frame*frmL+n+eta]
 * and to normalize this into a true cosine similarity, 
 * sc[frame*lagL+eta] = sqrt( (\sum_{n=0}^{winL-1} xp[frame*frmL+n]^2)
 *                            * (\sum_{n=0}^{winL-1} xp[frame*frmL+n+eta]^2) )
 * The algorithm actually runs one lag at a time, running through 
 * calculating and summing the products.  To avoid looking at each point 
 * more than once (per lag value), we keep a "running total", and update 
 * it for each frame by adding in the next frmL points, and subtracting 
 * away the sum of the frmL points that have been shifted out of the start 
 * of the window (so the contribution of points in the overlap between two 
 * successive windows remains unchanged in the sum).  Further, to avoid 
 * having to look back at the points from the beginning of the window, 
 * we keep track of the points that are going to fall into each 
 * "subtract away" portion as we see them the first time, then put those 
 * sums into a little ring FIFO buffer, so we can simply read out the 
 * right value to subtract for each block.

 * I added the FIFO to avoid recalculating the portion to subtract away.
